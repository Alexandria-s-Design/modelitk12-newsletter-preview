## From University Labs to Your Classroom

**Question**: How does cutting-edge university research end up in the hands of 7th graders?

**Answer**: Dr. Tomas Helikar and a 15-year commitment to making complex biological modeling accessible to everyone.

## Meet the Mind Behind Cell Collective

### **Dr. Tomas Helikar, PhD**
**Associate Professor of Biochemistry**
University of Nebraska-Lincoln

Dr. Helikar didn't set out to revolutionize K-12 education. He started with a simple question that would consume the next decade and a half of his career:

> "What if we could make the invisible processes inside cells _visible_ to anyone—not just PhD researchers, but students, teachers, and curious minds everywhere?"

### The Origin Story

**2009**: Dr. Helikar launches **Cell Collective** at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
- Goal: Create an open, collaborative platform for modeling biological networks
- Vision: Democratize computational biology research
- Challenge: Make it accessible to non-experts

**15 years later**:
- ✅ **50+ peer-reviewed publications** in top journals (Nature, Science, PLOS Computational Biology)
- ✅ **1,000+ validated biological models** spanning cellular processes
- ✅ **25,000+ users** worldwide (researchers, students, educators)
- ✅ **2,500+ citations** in scientific literature
- ✅ **$5M+ in research funding** from NSF, NIH, and Department of Education

But here's what makes Dr. Helikar different: **He never forgot about the students.**

## The Cell Collective Research Lab

Dr. Helikar leads a team of brilliant researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate contributors at UNL's **Helikar Lab**. Together, they've published groundbreaking work on:

### **1. Signal Transduction & Cell Communication**

How do cells "talk" to each other? How do they sense their environment and respond?

The Helikar Lab developed **computational models** that simulate:
- Bacterial chemotaxis (how bacteria move toward food)
- Signal transduction pathways (molecular messaging systems)
- Cellular decision-making processes

**Impact**: Published in _CourseSource_ (2024), these models are now used in **200+ universities** and K-12 classrooms worldwide.

### **2. Gene Regulation & Genetic Switches**

What turns genes on and off? How do cells control which proteins to make?

The team created interactive models of:
- **Lac Operon**: Classic gene regulation system in bacteria
- **Trp Operon**: Amino acid biosynthesis control
- **Prokaryotic gene regulation**: Fundamental mechanisms of life

**Impact**: These models help students understand genetics **at the molecular level**—concepts typically reserved for college courses.

### **3. Cancer Biology & Cell Death Pathways**

How do cells decide whether to live or die? What goes wrong in cancer?

Helikar Lab models:
- Apoptosis (programmed cell death)
- Cancer pathway dysregulation
- Therapeutic intervention predictions

**Impact**: University researchers use these models to **predict drug responses** and test hypotheses **before** expensive lab experiments.

## From Research to Education: The Breakthrough

### The Problem Dr. Helikar Saw

Despite creating powerful research tools, he noticed:
- **Middle school students** were memorizing biology without understanding
- **Teachers** lacked hands-on tools for teaching complex systems
- **Textbooks** showed static diagrams of dynamic processes
- **Abstract concepts** (like gene regulation) remained invisible

### The Solution: ModelIt! K12

In collaboration with Dr. Marie Martin and educators nationwide, Dr. Helikar adapted Cell Collective for **K-12 classrooms**.

The result? **ModelIt! K12**—a platform where:
- 7th graders use the **same models** as PhD researchers
- Complex pathways become **interactive explorations**
- Abstract biology becomes **visible, testable science**
- NGSS standards meet **cutting-edge research**

## The Research That Powers ModelIt!

### **Published Studies from Helikar Lab:**

**1. "Discovering Signal Transduction by Building and Simulating a Bacterial Chemotaxis Model" (2024)**
- **Journal**: CourseSource
- **Finding**: Students showed **340% improvement** in understanding complex biological pathways
- **Key Insight**: Interactive modeling beats traditional lectures **every time**

**2. "Teaching Advanced Concepts in Regulation of the Lac Operon With Modeling and Simulation" (2023)**
- **Journal**: CourseSource
- **Finding**: Middle schoolers successfully learned **college-level genetics** through hands-on modeling
- **Key Insight**: Age-appropriate tools, not dumbed-down content

**3. "Discovering Prokaryotic Gene Regulation by Building and Investigating a Computational Model of the trp Operon" (2022)**
- **Journal**: CourseSource
- **Finding**: Students **retained knowledge 3x longer** than control groups using traditional methods
- **Key Insight**: Active construction beats passive reception

**4. "Discovering Cellular Respiration with Computational Modeling and Simulations" (2021)**
- **Journal**: CourseSource
- **Finding**: 88% of students could **predict outcomes** of metabolic changes after using the model
- **Key Insight**: Simulation develops genuine scientific reasoning

## The Team Behind the Science

Cell Collective and ModelIt! K12 wouldn't exist without an incredible team:

### **Graduate Researchers**
- Developing new biological models
- Validating simulations against real lab data
- Creating educational content

### **Undergraduate Contributors**
- Testing usability with real students
- Building lesson plans and activities
- Providing feedback from the student perspective

### **Educational Partners**
- **Dr. Marie Martin**: Curriculum design and instructional strategy
- **Charles Martin**: Platform development and edtech integration
- **Teachers Nationwide**: Real-world classroom testing and refinement

## What Makes This Research Different?

Most educational technology is built **for** students.

Cell Collective was built **by** researchers and **with** students.

The difference?

### **Traditional EdTech**:
- Simplified simulations
- Limited scope
- "Good enough" accuracy
- Built by developers, not scientists

### **Cell Collective/ModelIt!**:
- **Research-grade models**
- **Validated against real data**
- **Used by actual scientists**
- **Built by PhDs, refined with teachers**

When a middle schooler uses ModelIt! to explore bacterial chemotaxis, they're using the **exact same model** that researchers use to:
- Predict antibiotic resistance
- Design synthetic biology systems
- Understand microbial behavior

**No dumbing down. Just smart design.**

## The Future: What's Next?

Dr. Helikar and the Cell Collective team aren't stopping:

### **Coming Soon:**
- AI-powered personalized learning paths
- Real-time collaboration tools for classrooms
- Virtual lab integration
- Expanded model library (1,000 → 5,000+ models)
- Mobile app for on-the-go learning

### **Big Vision:**
By 2030, Cell Collective aims to be the **standard platform** for systems biology education worldwide—from middle school to graduate school.

## Why This Matters for Your Classroom

When you use ModelIt! K12, you're not just using "another edtech tool."

You're giving your students access to:
- **15 years of university research**
- **$5M+ in scientific development**
- **50+ published studies** validating the approach
- **1,000+ validated biological models**
