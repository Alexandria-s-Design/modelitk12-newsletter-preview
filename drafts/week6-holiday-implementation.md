Holiday Implementation Guide: Winter Break Activities and Independent Student Projects

Let’s turn winter break into a low‑stress win for you and a high‑value learning experience for your students. This guide gives you ready-to-use, NGSS-aligned ModelIt K12 projects that students can complete independently, plus rubrics, choice boards, differentiation tips, and parent communication templates you can copy and paste today.

Why ModelIt K12 works for independent holiday learning
- Research‑grounded: ModelIt K12 is built on the Cell Collective platform, backed by 15+ years of research and used in 50+ peer‑reviewed publications. The modeling approach and tools have been rigorously studied for learning gains in life science and systems thinking.
- NGSS alignment you can point to: Every activity in this guide is anchored in NGSS Middle School Life Science standards (MS‑LS1, MS‑LS2) and highlights NGSS Science and Engineering Practice 2: Developing and Using Models.
- Teacher‑verifiable platform features:
  - Browser‑based access (no installs) that works on school‑issued Chromebooks or laptops.
  - A curated library of ready‑to‑assign middle school life science models (for example: Insulin–Glucose Regulation, Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration, Ecosystem Interactions and Carrying Capacity).
  - Interactive simulations where students adjust inputs and observe system behavior on dynamic graphs.
  - Built‑in prompts and response fields students can complete directly in the activity.
  - Teacher assignment workflows for sharing activities with classes and collecting student responses in one place.
  - Save‑and‑return functionality so students can complete work in short sessions over the break.

What students can realistically do on their own over break
- Run a self‑paced investigation in a pre‑built ModelIt K12 model.
- Compare two or more scenarios by changing inputs and describing how and why outputs change.
- Capture evidence using model graphs and screenshots.
- Write short, claim‑evidence‑reasoning reflections based on their simulations.
- Submit their work through your LMS or directly in ModelIt K12 (according to how your district manages submissions).

NGSS alignment at a glance
- NGSS Practice 2: Developing and Using Models is the core practice in every project below. Students actively manipulate a computational model, test ideas, and use outputs to construct explanations.
- MS‑LS1 focus areas:
  - MS‑LS1‑6: Photosynthesis converts light energy into stored chemical energy.
  - MS‑LS1‑7: Cellular respiration releases energy for cellular processes.
  - MS‑LS1‑3: Body systems interact to carry out functions (e.g., regulation of blood glucose).
- MS‑LS2 focus areas:
  - MS‑LS2‑1: Resource availability affects populations in ecosystems.
  - MS‑LS2‑2: Patterns of interactions among organisms in ecosystems.
  - MS‑LS2‑4: Changes to components of an ecosystem affect population dynamics and ecosystem stability.

Step‑by‑step: Set it up before break
1) Choose 1–2 projects below that fit your pacing.
2) Open ModelIt K12 and locate the corresponding model(s) in the middle school library.
3) Use the assignment workflow in your teacher account to assign the activity to your class. Include:
   - Due date (suggested: first class back or a flexible window).
   - Submission instructions (where to turn in screenshots or written reflections).
   - Rubric criteria (use the provided outlines below).
4) Post a short announcement in your LMS and send the parent letter template (included in each project).
5) Show students a 5‑minute demo before break:
   - Where to find the assignment.
   - How to start a simulation, change an input, and read a graph.
   - What to submit (two screenshots and a short reflection is a simple, reliable minimum).

Step‑by‑step: Student directions to include in your assignment
- Log in to ModelIt K12 and open the assigned model activity.
- Read the driving question and prediction prompt.
- Run the baseline simulation, observe the graphs, and make a prediction.
- Change one variable at a time (as directed), run the simulation again, and compare outcomes.
- Capture evidence: take 1–2 screenshots of graphs for each scenario.
- Write a short response using claim, evidence, reasoning.
- Submit your screenshots and responses as directed (LMS or within the ModelIt K12 activity).

Step‑by‑step: Wrap‑up after break
- Skim student submissions and tag a few exemplars for discussion.
- Use the rubric outline to score key dimensions: modeling process, evidence use, and explanation quality.
- Open class debrief: 10–15 minutes to compare scenarios, highlight different strategies, and surface lingering questions for your next unit.

Ready‑to‑use project ideas for winter break
Each project below includes NGSS alignment, exactly which ModelIt K12 model to use, time estimates, an assessment rubric outline, and a parent letter snippet you can paste into your LMS message.

  - Explanation quality (3 pts): Claim is accurate; reasoning references system interactions (pancreas, insulin, cells).
  - Reflection (2 pts): Student notes a limitation or a new question to test next.
- Differentiation options:
  - Provide sentence starters: “When sugar intake increased, the model showed… This suggests that…”
  - Allow audio or short video explanation if writing is a barrier.
- Parent letter snippet:
  - Over winter break, your student will explore a safe, web‑based science model that shows how the body balances blood sugar. No downloads are required. The activity takes about 45–60 minutes and can be split across days. Your student will run simple simulations and write a short explanation. Questions? Please message me in our LMS.
- Teacher setup tips:
  - In your assignment instructions, include an example screenshot of the glucose graph so students know what to capture.
  - Remind students to label each screenshot “Baseline,” “Scenario A,” and “Scenario B.”

Project 2: Short Days, Big Questions — Photosynthesis and Respiration
- NGSS alignment:
  - Practice 2: Developing and Using Models.
  - MS‑LS1‑6: Photosynthesis converts light energy to stored chemical energy.
  - MS‑LS1‑7: Cellular respiration releases energy for cellular processes.

  - Scientific accuracy (3 pts): Correctly connects light availability to photosynthesis and respiration dynamics.
  - Communication (2 pts): Clear, concise writing with correct vocabulary (photosynthesis, respiration, glucose, oxygen).
- Differentiation options:
  - Provide a vocabulary mini‑glossary inside the assignment.
  - Offer a “quick path” prompt: Run only Baseline and Scenario A, then explain.
- Parent letter snippet:
  - Your student will use an online model to explore how daylight affects plant processes. This is a self‑paced activity (about an hour) with simple steps: run a simulation, compare two scenarios, and write a short explanation supported by a graph.
- Teacher setup tips:
  - Encourage students to annotate graphs (arrows or captions in their screenshots) to highlight peaks or rate changes.

Project 3: Winter Scarcity — Ecosystem Interactions and Carrying Capacity
- NGSS alignment:
  - Practice 2: Developing and Using Models.

  - Evidence use (3 pts): Uses graph features (amplitude, period, equilibrium) to support claims.
  - Argumentation (3 pts): Logical, evidence‑based reasoning about stability or regime shift.
  - Communication (2 pts): Organized, well‑labeled outputs and clear writing.
- Differentiation options:
  - Provide sentence frames for argumentation: “The system is stable/unstable because… As evidence, the graph shows…”
- Parent letter snippet:
  - Your student will explore how an invasive species can change an ecosystem using a safe, web‑based science modeling tool. The activity is self‑paced and takes about an hour. They will compare scenarios and submit short explanations with screenshots.

Mini‑investigations students can finish in 20–30 minutes
If you prefer micro‑tasks during break, assign one mini‑investigation instead of a full project. Each aligns to Practice 2 and a specific MS standard:

- MS‑LS1‑6: Net oxygen
  - Model: Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration.
  - Task: With light intensity set low, increase temperature stepwise and identify when oxygen production peaks. Submit one annotated screenshot and a two‑sentence explanation.

- MS‑LS1‑3: Body systems interact
  - Model: Insulin–Glucose Regulation.
  - Task: Compare recovery time to baseline glucose with and without increased physical activity. Submit a screenshot and a short claim.

- MS‑LS2‑1: Resource availability
  - Model: Ecosystem Interactions and Carrying Capacity.
  - Task: Reduce producer resources by 25% and note the first population to show a decline and the time lag before predator response.

Choice boards with ModelIt models
Give students agency with a simple, verifiable choice board. Ask them to pick any two tasks and submit one page of outputs.

- Investigate
  - Change one input in your assigned model and predict the outcome before you run it. After running, explain why your prediction was correct or incorrect.
- Compare
  - Run two scenarios and create a side‑by‑side screenshot of the graphs. Label each and circle one surprising pattern.
- Explain
  - Write a claim‑evidence‑reasoning paragraph that answers the driving question for your model.
- Extend
  - Propose one new scenario to test after the break and explain which graph you would use to evaluate it and why.
- Connect
  - Identify a real‑world situation that matches one scenario from your model (for example, shorter winter days). Explain the connection in 3–5 sentences.

Assessment strategies for independent work
- Keep it simple: Score three dimensions across all options:
  - Modeling actions: Did the student run a baseline and at least one comparison, changing one variable at a time?
  - Evidence: Are graphs/screenshots present and clearly labeled? Do they reference specific features (peaks, timing, increases/decreases)?
  - Explanation: Does the student use model outputs to support a claim, with correct vocabulary?
- Single‑point rubric language you can paste in:
  - Proficient: Runs baseline and comparison scenario(s); includes labeled evidence; constructs an accurate claim with reasoning tied to model behavior.
  - Approaches: Runs only one scenario or lacks labels; claim is vague or not supported by the graph.
  - Extends: Tests more than two scenarios, compares trends quantitatively, and identifies a model limitation.
- Evidence collection tips:
  - Ask students to title each screenshot (Baseline, A, B) and circle one feature.
  - Require 2–3 sentences connecting evidence to the claim.
- Feedback in five minutes:
  - Star one strength tied to NGSS Practice 2.
  - Arrow one next step (e.g., “Label the time when glucose returns to baseline.”).

Parent communication strategies that work
- Be clear and brief:
  - What: A self‑paced, web‑based science investigation using ModelIt K12.
  - Why: Builds real‑world skills in modeling and evidence‑based explanation.
  - Time: 45–60 minutes, can be split across days.
  - How to help: Encourage your student to show you one graph and explain what changed between scenarios.
- Accessibility:
  - Emphasize no downloads required and that students can pause/resume.
  - Offer a paper‑based alternative if home internet is limited: students can sketch a simple before/after graph and write a short explanation based on their school‑time run.
- Follow‑up:
  - Invite families to message you in the LMS with questions.
  - Provide a due‑by window rather than a single date to accommodate holiday schedules.

Differentiation tips for all learners
- Multilingual learners:
  - Include a bilingual vocabulary mini‑list (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration, glucose, population) in your assignment post.
  - Provide sentence frames for predictions and claims.
- Students who benefit from structure:
  - Chunk the task into checkboxes: Baseline run, Scenario A run, Screenshot A, Claim, Evidence, Reasoning.
  - Offer a “minimum viable submission” option: one scenario plus a three‑sentence explanation.
- Advanced learners:
  - Encourage an additional scenario that changes two variables, with a short justification of why that’s a fair test.
  - Add a short extension prompt: Identify one assumption the model makes and how it could affect results.
- Executive function supports:
  - Recommend two 20‑minute sessions with a timer instead of one long session.
  - Provide a one‑page template for pasting screenshots and writing a claim.

How this aligns to NGSS Practice 2: Developing and Using Models
- Students use a computational model to:
  - Represent system components and interactions.
  - Test how changes to one part of the system affect the whole.
  - Generate evidence (graphs) to support explanations and arguments.
- You can explicitly call this out in your assignment: “This project targets NGSS Practice 2: Developing and Using Models. You will use simulations as evidence for your claim.”
